# MNIST
* Configured and implemented the following 7 different machine learning algorithms for classifying the MNIST dataset

1. [Linear Classifier](Codes/Linear_SGD.py)
2. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
3. Radial Basis Function Neural Network
4. One-Hidden Layer Fully Connected Multilayer Neural Network
5. Two-Hidden Layer Fully Connected Multilayer Neural Network
6. Two-Hidden Layer Fully Connected Multilayer Neural Network
7. Convolutional Neural Network

* Compared and analyzed the performance of the algorithms based on their validation accuracy
